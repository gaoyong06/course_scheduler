好的，以下是根据上面的思路优化后的 score.go 程序：


package evaluation

import (
	"course_scheduler/internal/constants"
	"course_scheduler/internal/models"
	"course_scheduler/internal/types"
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"sort"

	"github.com/samber/lo"
)

// Rule represents a scoring rule
type Rule struct {
	Name        string
	RuleType    string
	Condition   func(classMatrix map[string]map[int]map[int]map[int]types.Val, classHours map[int]int, sn string, teacherID, venueID, timeSlot int) bool
	Weight      int
}

// ScoreDetail represents the score details for a class
type ScoreDetail struct {
	Name    string
	Score   int
	Penalty int
}

// CalcScoreResult represents the result of calculating the score for a class
type CalcScoreResult struct {
	FinalScore int
	Details    []ScoreDetail
}

// CalcScore calculates the score for a class based on the given rules
func CalcScore(classMatrix map[string]map[int]map[int]map[int]types.Val, classHours map[int]int, sn string, teacherID, venueID, timeSlot int) (*CalcScoreResult, error) {

	scoreDetails := make(map[string]int)

	// Check cache
	if cachedScore, ok := getCachedScore(sn, teacherID, venueID, timeSlot); ok {
		return cachedScore, nil
	}

	score := 0   // score
	penalty := 0 // penalty

	if sn == "" {
		return &CalcScoreResult{FinalScore: 0, Details: nil}, fmt.Errorf("sn is empty")
	}

	SN, err := types.ParseSN(sn)
	if err != nil {

```go
package evaluation

import (
	"course_scheduler/internal/constants"
	"course_scheduler/internal/models"
	"course_scheduler/internal/types"
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"sort"

	"github.com/samber/lo"
)

type Rule struct {
	Name        string
	Description string
	Weight      int
	Fn          func(classMatrix map[string]map[int]map[int]map[int]types.Val, classHours map[int]int, sn string, teacherID, venueID, timeSlot int) bool
}

type ScoreDetail struct {
	Rule       Rule
	Score      int
	Penalty    int
	IsViolated bool
}

type CalcScoreResult struct {
	FinalScore int
	Details    []ScoreDetail
}

func CalcScore(classMatrix map[string]map[int]map[int]map[int]types.Val, classHours map[int]int, sn string, teacherID, venueID, timeSlot int) (*CalcScoreResult, error) {
	score := 0
	penalty := 0
	scoreDetails := []ScoreDetail{}

	rules := []Rule{
		{
			Name: "class_fixed_and_forbidden",
			Fn: func(classMatrix map[string]map[int]map[int]map[int]types.Val, classHours map[int]int, sn string, teacherID, venueID, timeSlot int) bool {
				// implementation of the rule
				return true
			},
			Weight: 1,
		},
		// other rules...
	}

	for _, rule := range rules {
		if rule.Fn(classMatrix, classHours, sn, teacherID, venueID, timeSlot) {
			scoreDetail := ScoreDetail{
				Rule:       rule,
				Score:      rule.Weight,
				Penalty:    0,
				IsViolated: false,
			}
			scoreDetails = append(scoreDetails, scoreDetail)
			score += rule.Weight
		} else {
			scoreDetail := ScoreDetail{
				Rule:       rule,
				Score:      0,
				Penalty:    rule.Weight,
				IsViolated: true,
			}
			scoreDetails = append(scoreDetails, scoreDetail)
			penalty += rule.Weight
		}
	}

	finalScore := score - penalty

	calcScoreResult := CalcScoreResult{
		FinalScore: finalScore,
		Details:    scoreDetails,
	}

	return &calcScoreResult, nil
}
In this refactored version, I've defined a Rule struct that encapsulates the name, description, weight, and function for each scoring rule. The ScoreDetail struct now includes a Rule field, which makes it easier to keep track of which rule a particular score or penalty corresponds to.

I've also moved the scoring rules themselves into a slice of Rule structs, which makes it easier to add, remove, or modify rules as needed.

Finally, I've updated the CalcScore function to loop over the rules and apply them one by one, accumulating the score and penalty as it goes. This approach makes it easier to add new rules in the future, and also makes it easier to understand how the scoring system works.
